# Interpretability-methods-for-self-supervised-and-supervised-models
In recent years, the rapid development of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) has led to a remarkable performance in many complex tasks in the field of computer vision at the cost of the modelsâ€™ complexity. The more complex the models get, the higher the need is for understanding them. The primary objective of this repo is to give visual explanations on what both supervised and self-supervised methods really learn during training. Self-supervised and supervised state-of-the-art pre-trained models will be investigated. As backbone networks, for both categories convnets and Transformers based architectures will be used. Variation of visualization techniques will be used. 

This repo is a reproduction of https://github.com/jacobgil/pytorch-grad-cam to better understand self-supervised and supervised methods.
So any further information about the requirements of the environment and the way each script is executed can be found in the original code

In this set of experiments I try to interpret the following models.

Cait source --> https://github.com/facebookresearch/deit model:cait_s24_384
Deit source --> https://github.com/facebookresearch/deit model:deit_base_patch16_224
Dino_res source --> https://github.com/facebookresearch/dino backbone:dino_resnet50   /classifier weights:dino_resnet50_linearweights.pth 
Dino_xcit source --> https://github.com/facebookresearch/dino backbone:dino_xcit_small_12_p16    /classifier weights:dino_xcit_small_12_p16_linearweights.pth
Res50 source --> torchvision.models.resnet.resnet50
SwinT source --> https://fastai.github.io/timmdocs/ model:swin_base_patch4_window7_224
Xcit source --> https://github.com/facebookresearch/xcit model weights:xcit_small_12_p16_224.pth

In order to execute the Xcit_main.py one has to download first the xcit_small_12_p16_224.pth from https://github.com/facebookresearch/xcit and simply put the .pth file to the pretrained_weights folder!
